# Welcome to WUPHF!


This is a react native project for HackMT written in typescript. 

### What youll need to get started
1. (npm)[https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm] and or yarn : 
These are package managers to make it easy to install dependencies/libraries for our app dev. Node.js and npm come together. You will need Node.js to serve your javascript/typecsript code
2. Node.js  : Mentioned above, comes with npm
3. (Expo)[https://expo.io/learn]  : This is a tool to help make react native development easier. 
4. (VSCode)[https://code.visualstudio.com/] : everyone develops in this. Therr are extensions below that I SUPER suggest you get to make things easier for you. 
5. The expo app. This lets us run the app on your device. 


### Getting started
1. Clone the repo and open it in vs code
2. In a terminal in the directory run
`npm install`
to get all the dependencies listed in `package.json` (where all dependencies are listed.. like gradle)
3. run `expo start` this will start serving your app and launch in browser the expo tool
4. In the expo app on your phone, scan the QR code and it should show your app. 

### Those dope plugins i talked about
. prettier (a plug in that helps auto format code and legit saves time). Once you get it google how to make it format on save
. vs code styled components (we will make most ui's using styled componets. This plug in will come in handy)
